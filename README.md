# 📁 Project Documentation

# 🚀 1. Project Ideation & Initiation

## **1.1 Mobile App Details**

### **a. Title**
*Insert app title here*

### **b. Background of the Problem**
Explain:
- What problem exists?
- Why is it important?
- How does it affect users?

### **c. Objective**
- To streamline group project management by improving communication and collaboration among team members through features like real time notifications, task tracking, peer reviews, and location based meeting assistance.  
- To enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of group project collaboration by providing tools for real time communication, task management, reminders, peer feedback, and in person coordination through sensors and Bluetooth.  

### **d. Target Users**
- Students working on group projects in colleges or universities.
- Remote and hybrid teams needing efficient collaboration tools.
- Anyone involved in small project-based teams who require reminders, task tracking, and easy coordination.

### **e. Preferred Platform**
Platform: Android and iOS

Why: Targets the widest possible user base (students) who use smartphones for daily communication and quick task management.
Why Flutter: Chosen for cross-platform development from a single codebase, which minimizes development time and costs while delivering native performance on both Android and iOS.  

### **f. Features & Functionalities**
List and explain the main features:
- Feature 1 — Task Tracking & Status Updates
Displays tasks, deadlines, and current status (to do, in progress, etc.)

- Feature 2 — Real-time Communication & "Beep"
In-app chat with an urgent, high-priority "beep" via push notification.

- Feature 3 — Collaborative Review System
Allows members to upload work for others to provide structured ratings and feedback.

- Feature 4 (Optional) - Location-Based Check-in
Uses Bluetooth/GPS to automatically verify and log attendance at physical group meetings.

## **1.2 Justification of the Proposed App**
The proposed app which is Group Project Monitoring App is conceived to solved such problems in students and team collaboration which is focusing on simplicity and accountability.
Describe clearly:
- **Why** the app idea was selected
    -The app was selected to address a specific solution to uneven workload distribution and scattered communication in group project.  
- **How** the idea came up
    - The idea was first came up when the lecture came along with a great idea about group project monitoring application which is kind of interesting. Also, the concept arise from lot of students frustation which is lack of clear and real time visibility into who is doing what, leading to last minute group project.  
- Existing solutions and gaps
    - Some of applications and websites already exist to solve this problem such as Trello, Asana and Jira. These existing applications offer robust, enterprise-grade tracking, reporting and integrations. The existing solutions are powerful enough but also create some significant barriers for students. These applications are typically overprice and higly cost for students.  
- What makes your idea needed / unique  
    - Our app is a specialized solution that is genuinely needed because it focuses on a niche underserved by complex enterprise software. 
    Core Unique Feature: Accountability Score/Visualization. This feature calculates and displays an individual's contribution based on timely task completion and peer feedback, providing instant, objective data for group members and instructors.
    Needed Because: It is a mobile-first, low-friction tool designed specifically for short-term, academic collaboration, allowing groups to onboard and begin monitoring work in minutes, directly solving the problem of social loafing and administrative overhead.
